In these cases the subscriber count is taken to be zero; a more sophisticate approach may be to look at the daily views and subscriber counts of a similar channel to form an estimate of the subscriber base. ",-1),c=(0,s.Wm)("p",null," A second complication is that the view and subscriber counts can go backwards. It is conjectured that this occurs when Youtube audits a channel's traffic and determines that some subscribers and/or views are fraudulent. Channels may engage in fraudulent behavior in order to gain more ad revenue or to look more influential than they really are. Negative view counts would confound the various metrics this site presents, so when these corrections are observed older data is adjusted to prevent the appearance of negative numbers. Suppose that over the course of a few days the view counts for a channel were 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1450. Subtracting the previous day's count from each view count would yield 100, 100, 100, and -50 views. To deal with this we look back in the data to the last time the view count was less than 1450 and draw a straight line from that days view count to 1450. This linear interpolation is not a sophisticated approach, but it has the benefit of looking fairly obvious when graphed (it shows up as a straight line). In any case, the raw data is always retained unaltered in the database file for anyone who wishes to use it.
